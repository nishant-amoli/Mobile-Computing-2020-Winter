Tip Calculator


About
This android applicaion provides the basic tip calculating functionality. The user needs to enter the base amount, the number of people sharing the bill, and the tip percentage. Initially the tip percentage is set to 15% and the bill is not shared that is, the party size is 1. As soon as the user enters the the base amount, the tip amount is automatically calculated and displayed. As the user slides the tip scroller, the tip amount will automatically change and displayed on the screen. However, the total bill amount will only be computed and displayed after the user presses the Calculate button. Now depending upon the party size, the total amount will be displayed. If the party size is 1, only the total amount will be displayed. If the party size is more than 1, the amount will be splitted equally among the total number of people sharing the bill and the amount per person will be displayed. After the calculation, if the user changes the state of any field, the total amount will be erased and after the change has been made, the Calculate button is needed to be pressed again. The Reset button will set all the fields to the default. Also, the application handles the typing errors that a user might commit such as party size 0, decimal without 0, decimal more than once, blank fields, calculating without entering the amount, e.t.c.
